===================================================================================================
Instrumented tests:
  Unit tests that run on an Android device or emulator. These tests have access to instrumentation
information, such as the Context for the app under test. Use this approach to run unit tests that
have Android dependencies which cannot be easily filled by using mock objects.
===================================================================================================

===================================================================================================
"""
You should create instrumented unit tests if your tests need access to instrumentation information
(such as the target app's Context) or if they require the real implementation of an Android
framework component (such as a Parcelable or SharedPreferences object). Using instrumented
unit tests also helps to reduce the effort required to write and maintain mock code. You are still
free to use a mocking framework, if you choose, to simulate any dependency relationships.
Instrumented unit tests can take advantage of the Android framework APIs and supporting APIs,
such as the Android Testing Support Library.
"""


"""
Your instrumented unit test class should be written as a JUnit 4 test class,
To create an instrumented JUnit 4 test class, add the @RunWith(AndroidJUnit4.class) annotation
at the beginning of your test class definition. You also need to specify the AndroidJUnitRunner class
provided in the Android Testing Support Library as your default test runner.
"""

"""
The AndroidJUnitRunner class is a JUnit test runner that lets you run JUnit 3 or JUnit 4-style test 
classes on Android devices, including those using the Espresso and UI Automator testing frameworks. 
The test runner handles loading your test package and the app under test to a device, running your 
tests, and reporting test results. This class replaces the InstrumentationTestRunner class, 
which only supports JUnit 3 tests.
